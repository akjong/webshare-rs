Set of rules indicating which proxies to replace from and replace with in a proxy list. You can add a query-string parameter `plan_id` in case you want to target a specific plan otherwise it will use the default plan.

# The proxy replacement object

### Parameters

Attributes| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`id`| `number`| Unique identified of the proxy replacement instance.  
`to_replace`| `dictionary`| Dictionary indicating which proxies to replace. Complete field definition can be found below.  
`replace_with`| `list of dictionaries`| List of dictionaries indicating which proxies to replace with. Complete field definition can be found below. Availability can be retrieved using [Proxy Configuration](/proxy-config)  
`dry_run`| `boolean`| You can dry-run a replacement to learn number of proxies removed/added prior to actually replacing the proxy list. `dry_run=True` does not modify the proxy list.  
`state`| `string`| The current state of the proxy replacement can be: `validating`, `validated`, `processing`, `completed` and `failed`. If failed, error_code and error will have values to describe the error.  
`proxies_removed`| `number`| Number of proxies removed from the proxy list.  
`proxies_added`| `number`| Number of proxies added to the proxy list.  
`reason`| `string`| The reason proxies were replaced. You can view all reasons in the table below. Manually creating a replacement sets the reason as `proxy_replaced`.  
`error_code`| `string`| The error code.  
`error`| `string`| The error message.  
`created_at`| `string`| The timestamp of when this instance was created.  
`dry_run_completed_at`| `string`| The timestamp of when this instance state became `validated`. May be `null`.  
`completed_at`| `string`| The timestamp of when this instance state became `completed`. May be `null`.  
  
### Replacement reasons

Reason| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`list_updated`| `string`| Proxy was removed/added due to change of subscription.  
`proxy_replaced`| `string`| Proxy was replaced manually by the user.  
`auto_invalidated`| `string`| Proxy was auto-replaced due to failing status checks for over 15 minutes. This automated action can be turned off via the [Proxy Config API](/proxy-config).  
`auto_out_of_rotation`| `string`| Proxy was auto-replaced due to moving out of rotation by Webshare admins. This usually indicates that the proxy is not performing at 100%. This automated action can be turned off via the [Proxy Config API](/proxy-config).  
`auto_low_country_confidence`| `string`| Proxy was auto-replaced due to country code change. This automated action can be turned off via the [Proxy Config API](/proxy-config).  
`auto_deleted`| `string`| The proxy was deleted from the system. This is an automated action and cannot be turned off.

## Replacement Definitions

There are 3 types of value for `to_replace` | `replace_with` fields. a `replace_with` may be a list of dictionaries/types as we may not have enough replacements from one country.

For example, if we want to replace 10 US proxies with 5 French and 5 Turkish, you can use the fields as follows:
    
    
    ## To Replace
    to_replace: { type: "country", country_code: "US", count: 10 }
     
    ## Replace with
    replace_with: [
        { type: "country", country_code: "FR", count: 5 },
        { type: "country", country_code: "TR", count: 5 }
    ]
