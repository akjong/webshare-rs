IP Authorization

# IP Authorization

Webshare proxy offers 2 methods for authenticating with the proxies: password and IP Authorization. If you do not wish to use password authentication, you can instead authorize your IP address using this API.

## The IP authorization object

Each IP Authorization instance has the following fields

Attributes| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`id`| `int`| The unique ID of the IP Authorization object.  
`ip_address`| `string`| The IP address which is authorized to connect to the proxies without username/password.  
`created_at`| `string`| The timestamp of when this instance was created.  
`last_used_at`| `string`| The timestamp when this IP address was last used.
