Proxy List

# Proxy List API

You can use the Webshare API to retrieve your proxy list in 2 modes: `direct` and `backbone`. Each mode returns the same proxy data structure with minor changes on how the fields are used.

## Backbone Proxy

Backbone proxy connections always use `p.webshare.io` connection address. In username/password authentication, the following ports can be used: `80`, `1080`, `3128` and `9999 - 19999`. The IP Authentication mode, you must use the `port` field returned from the API.

## Direct Proxy

Direct proxy connections use the `proxy_address` and `port` field returned from the API. Same fields are used across username/password and IP Authentication modes.

## The Proxy object

Attributes| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`id`| `string`| Unique identifier of the proxy instance.  
`username`| `string`| Proxy username.  
`password`| `string`| Proxy password.  
`proxy_address`| `string`| IP Address of the proxy. In Direct Connection mode, connect to this IP address. In Backbone Connection mode, connect to `p.webshare.io`. This field is `null if `plan.pool_filter`is`residential`.  
`port`| `int`| Port used to connect to the proxies. In Backbone mode, the port is always set for IP Authorization.
