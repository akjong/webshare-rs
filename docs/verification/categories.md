Verification categories

## Verification Categories

This API lets you retrieve information about the different verification categories that may trigger verification flows. Each category represents a specific type of proxy usage pattern that may require verification.

### Parameters

Parameter| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`description`| `string`| Description of the verification category. Can be user visible.  
`request_threshold`| `null`| Previously indicated the threshold number of requests that would trigger verification for this category. Now always returns null.  
`id_verification_required`| `boolean`| Whether this verification category requires ID verification when triggered.  
`id_verification_restores_access`| `boolean`| Whether this verification category restores proxy access when ID verification is completed.  
  
### Examples
