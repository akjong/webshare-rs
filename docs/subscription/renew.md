Renew the subscription

# Renew the subscription

You can use this API to renew the subscription. After renewal, you will receive additional `subscription.renewals_paid`.

Attributes| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`payment_method`| `int`| The payment method to use. Can be `null` to use the payment on file, or an existing payment method id.  
`term`| `string`| The term to renew. Can be `yearly` or `monthly`.  
`recaptcha`| `string`| The recaptcha token (can be invisible recaptcha). Optional: Only required if a payment is required. If using account credits, no recaptcha is required.  
  
This API endpoint requires recaptcha validation if a payment is required. If you have enough account credits, no payment is required. When a payment is required you should not be using this API endpoint programmatically and only use it from the Webshare Dashboard.
