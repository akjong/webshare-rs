[Subscription](/subscription)

Purchase a plan

# Purchase a plan

You can use this API to purchase a new plan. A new plan will override your existing plan and update your `subscription.start_date`.

The purchase API uses the same parameters as the [Subscription pricing](/subscription/pricing) endpoint with 2 additional fields: `payment_method` and `recaptcha`.

This API endpoint requires recaptcha validation if a payment is required. If you have enough account credits, no payment is required. When a payment is required you should not be using this API endpoint programmatically and only use it from the Webshare Dashboard.

## Request fields

The purchase API uses the same parameters as the [Subscription pricing](/subscription/pricing) endpoint with 2 additional fields: `payment_method`, `behavior`.

Parameter| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`behavior`| `string`| Can be 2 options. 1) `replace`, (default value) the new purchased plan will replace the old one, this option is only supported for subscriptions with a single plan. 2) `add`, for adding the plan to the subscription.
