Subscription

# Subscription

⚠️

**Important distinction between Subscription and Plan**

Subscription stays with the user even after a user switches to a new Plan. Whereas, a new Plan object is created each time a customer re-customizes their Plan.

Each Webshare account has 1 subscription and 1 active plan associated with it. There may be multiple in-active plans.

Subscription object holds general information about the user subscription
e.g. start/end dates.

[See the Plan API](/subscription/plan).
