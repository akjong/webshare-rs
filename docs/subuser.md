Sub-Users

# Sub-Users

Each sub-user can have separate limits and proxy list. The proxy list of the users you create are based on your main proxy list.

You can make requests to [Proxy Configuration](/subuser#proxy-configuration), [Proxy List](/subuser#proxy-list) and [Proxy Stats](/subuser#proxy-stats) APIs as a sub-user using the `X-Subuser` header. More [examples below](/subuser#masquerade-user).

This API is only available for after accepting additional terms for Webshare sub-user portal. If you wish to gain access to this API, please complete the form at <https://proxy.webshare.io/subuser/>[ (opens in a new tab)](https://proxy.webshare.io/subuser/)

### Sub-User object

You can use the API to create, retrieve, update and delete each individual sub-user.

Attributes| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`id`| `int`| Unique identifier of the user. The ID never changes and no other user will receive the same ID.  
`label`| `string`| You can set label to identify your users.  
`proxy_countries`| `dict`| Can be set to `null` to disable custom proxy lists. Otherwise, dictionary of [country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) and number of proxies. `ZZ` country code is special and means any available country.  
`proxy_limit`| `float`| The user proxy limit in GBs. You can set to 0 in order to get unlimited bandwidth.  
`max_thread_count`| `int`| The maximum number of proxy request concurrency this user can have.  
`aggregate_stat`| `dict`| Proxy stats for this sub-user. Follows the same format as the Aggregate Stats API.  
`created_at`| `datetime`| Read-only field to indicate when this user was created.  
`updated_at`| `datetime`| Read-only field to indicate when this user was last updated.  
`bandwidth_use_start_date`| `datetime`| The time we start calculating the user bandwidth use. You can edit this field.  
`bandwidth_use_end_date`| `datetime`| The time the user bandwidth use will reset. Read-only field.
